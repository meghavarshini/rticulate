\title{Plot smooths from a polar \code{gam}}
\usage{
plot_polar_smooths(model, time_series, comparison, origin = NULL,
  facet_terms = NULL, conditions = NULL, exclude_random = TRUE,
  series_length = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A \code{gam} or \code{bam} model object.}

\item{time_series}{An unquoted expression indicating the model term that defines the time series.}

\item{comparison}{An unquoted expression indicating the model term for which the comparison will be plotted.}

\item{origin}{The coordinates of the origin as a vector of \code{c(x, y)} coordinates.}

\item{facet_terms}{An unquoted formula with the terms used for faceting.}

\item{conditions}{A list of quosures with \link[rlang]{quos} specifying the levels to plot from the model terms not among \code{time_series}, \code{comparison}, or \code{facet_terms}.}

\item{exclude_random}{Whether to exclude random smooths (the default is \code{TRUE}).}

\item{series_length}{An integer indicating how many values along the time series to use for predicting the outcome term.}
}
\description{
It plots the smooths of a polar GAM fitted with \code{polar_gam()}.
